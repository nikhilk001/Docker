Creating and connecting 3 nodes in digital ocean to demonstrate docker swarm

Create 3 droplets in digital ocean

After creating the droplets 

Copy the IP of first drop let to log in it

Give the path of ssh pub key with root@ip_of_droplet

Ssh -I ~/../.ssht/id_rsa root@ip

To initialise swarm in the VM we also need to install docker in it so use the bash script given


#i/bin/bash
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
yum -y install docker-ce
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker



Use following commands to create and run above script in the VM

Cd 
vim docker-install.sh
Chmod +x docker-install.sh
./docker-install.sh


Do the same thing in other 2 nodes as well


To check if docker is installed correctly do systemctl status docker


Then initialise one node as manager node

Do ifconfig in that node and get it Ip of eth0 

Ifconfig eth0
Docker swarm init â€”advertise-addr IP

Copy the command which is returned in the output to create the worker node and run that command in worker node


By running docker node ls 
In manager node you can see the information of connected worker nodes
