publishing ports is necessary to make the content available in all the containers 

created 3 containers one as manager and 2 as worker nodes.

docker service create --name mywebserver --replicas 2 --publish 8080:80 nginx

created this service 
if i hadnt published that port curl would not have worked

but now as the port has been published i just need to get the ip of ifconfig eth0 and curl it with port id

curl 143.198.50.179:8080

you can access the nginx server this way

this curl will work on other nodes as well and you can acess the content
