docker compose needs to be explicitly installed in linux

curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.27.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

then create a yml file

mkdir dockercompose
cd dockercompose
yum -y install vim
vim docker-compose.yml

#within this file youll define what are the services you require

services:
  webserver:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - 8080:80/tcp
  database:
    image: redis

then save the file and run 
docker-compose config

if file format is correct it will read the file or throw an error.

docker-compose up -d : to run
docker-compose down : to stop


Bonus:
after the application is up you can try
ifconfig eth0
curl 143.198.50.179:8080
